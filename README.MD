Trade Helper for PoE2 (requires ExileCore2)

Clone of Mercury Trade

Helper for trades, similar to Mercury Trade etc, adds window with buttons to interact while trading, you can customise your own fast reply buttons in FastReplyButtons.txt.

Shows stash tab where item is located, as well as its position.

Works with korean/chinese names (unlike client.txt), and somewhat works with most non english whispers, when buying items.
